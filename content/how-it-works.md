#### Hugo + GitHub + Cloudflare Pages
This website uses Hugo as its primary engine. All of the code were hosted at GitHub, then deployed as a static website at Cloudflare Pages.

#### Go + Heroku
The backend to generate the articles were written in Go, deployed at Heroku. It is a simple process to get the title data from Google Sheets, then call the ChatGPT API to create the article, and update the Hugo website by calling the GitHub API.

#### ChatGPT
The primary engine to create all of the articles in this website. I use `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, with the average of 800-1,000 tokens per article and with the price of $0.002/1K tokens, it costs around **$0.18/month** to generate all of the articles (3 articles per day).

#### Google Sheets
This is where I store the list of titles of articles I want to create. All of the titles were also generated by AI using ChatGPT.

#### Cloudflare Workers
This is used to trigger the content generation by calling the backend, triggered by cron every 8 hours.
