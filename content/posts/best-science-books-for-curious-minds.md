4. **The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark by Carl Sagan**, a book that defends the importance of critical thinking and scientific inquiry in a world filled with pseudoscience and superstition. Sagan argues that science is the best tool we have for understanding the universe and solving its mysteries.

5. **The Double Helix by James D. Watson**, a personal account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century.
