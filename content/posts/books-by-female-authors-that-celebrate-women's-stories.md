Looking for books that celebrate women's stories and experiences? Here are five must-reads by female authors that will inspire and empower you:

1. **The Color Purple by Alice Walker**, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that explores the lives of African American women in the 1930s. Through the eyes of Celie, a poor and uneducated woman, we witness the struggles and triumphs of black women as they navigate racism, sexism, and poverty.

2. **The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood**, a dystopian novel set in a future where women have been stripped of their rights and reduced to reproductive vessels. The story follows Offred, a handmaid who rebels against the oppressive regime she is trapped in.

3. **Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay**, a collection of essays that explores what it means to be a feminist in today's world. Through personal anecdotes and cultural commentary, Gay challenges traditional ideas of femininity, race, and sexuality.

4. **Becoming by Michelle Obama**, a memoir that traces Obama's journey from a working-class family in Chicago to the first African American First Lady of the United States. Through her experiences, Obama offers insights into the challenges and triumphs of being a woman in politics.

5. **The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath**, a semi-autobiographical novel that explores the mental health struggles of a young woman in the 1950s. Through the protagonist Esther Greenwood, Plath examines the gender roles and societal expectations that contribute to women's feelings of alienation and despair.
