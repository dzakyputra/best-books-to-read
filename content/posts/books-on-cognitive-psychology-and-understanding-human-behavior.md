Kahneman delves into various cognitive biases that influence our judgments and decisions, shedding light on why we often make irrational choices. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" offers a comprehensive understanding of the human mind and provides practical insights into how we can make better decisions by harnessing the strengths of both thinking systems.
