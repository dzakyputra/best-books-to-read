Harari challenges traditional notions of destiny by arguing that much of human history has been shaped by collective fictions, such as religion, money, and political systems. He questions whether our individual choices and actions truly determine our fate or if we are merely pawns in a larger societal narrative.

By reading "Sapiens," readers are prompted to reflect on the extent to which our destiny is predetermined by historical, cultural, and biological factors, and how much agency we truly possess in shaping our lives.
