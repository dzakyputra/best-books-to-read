Here are five essential reads that explore the culture of surveillance:

The novel introduces readers to the concept of Big Brother, a figurehead who symbolizes the oppressive surveillance state that monitors every aspect of citizens' lives. Through the character of Winston Smith, Orwell paints a chilling picture of a society where privacy is non-existent, and individuality is suppressed in the name of conformity and control.
