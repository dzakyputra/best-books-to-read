Delving into the collapse of civilizations can offer profound insights into the factors that contribute to the downfall of societies throughout history. From environmental degradation to political upheaval, various forces can lead to the collapse of once-thriving civilizations. If you are intrigued by this topic, here are five compelling books that explore the collapse of civilizations in different contexts:

### 1. "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed" by Jared Diamond

Tainter's interdisciplinary approach offers a comprehensive analysis of the collapse of civilizations and the role of complexity in their downfall.
