### 4. "Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion" by Paul Bloom

In "Against Empathy," psychologist Paul Bloom challenges the conventional wisdom that empathy is an unambiguously positive force in human interactions.

Rather than advocating for empathy, Bloom makes a case for "rational compassion," which he defines as a more reflective, reasoned, and principled approach to caring for others. He suggests that by cultivating a more rational form of compassion, we can avoid the pitfalls of empathy and make more ethical decisions that promote the greater good.
