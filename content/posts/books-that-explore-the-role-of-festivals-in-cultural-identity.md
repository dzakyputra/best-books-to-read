Festivals play a significant role in shaping cultural identity, celebrating traditions, and fostering a sense of community among people. They provide a platform for individuals to express their heritage, values, and beliefs through various art forms, rituals, and festivities. In the realm of literature, several books have delved into the profound impact of festivals on cultural identity. Here are five notable books that explore the role of festivals in shaping and preserving cultural heritage:
