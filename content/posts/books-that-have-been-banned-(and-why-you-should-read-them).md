"To Kill a Mockingbird" is a classic novel that addresses issues of racial injustice, moral courage, and empathy in the American South during the 1930s. Despite its enduring popularity and critical acclaim, the book has been banned in some school districts for its language and themes related to race, violence, and social inequality. However, "To Kill a Mockingbird" continues to be a powerful and poignant exploration of prejudice and compassion, urging readers to confront difficult truths about society and human nature.

Nevertheless, "The Catcher in the Rye" remains a compelling and introspective work that resonates with readers grappling with feelings of disillusionment, isolation, and the search for authenticity.

### 4. "Beloved" by Toni Morrison

"Beloved" is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that delves into the legacy of slavery, trauma, and memory in post-Civil War America.

### 5. "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley
