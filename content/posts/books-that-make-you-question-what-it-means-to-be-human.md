### 2. "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut

Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse-Five" is a genre-defying novel that challenges traditional notions of time, reality, and free will. Through the experiences of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II soldier who becomes "unstuck in time," Vonnegut explores the horrors of war, the randomness of fate, and the fragility of human existence. By blending elements of science fiction, satire, and autobiography, the novel invites readers to reconsider their perceptions of life, death, and the nature of consciousness.

### 4. "Blindness" by José Saramago
