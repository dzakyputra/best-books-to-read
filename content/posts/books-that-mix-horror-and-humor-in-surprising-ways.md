Here are five books that masterfully combine horror and humor in surprising ways:

### 1. "My Best Friend's Exorcism" by Grady Hendrix

This novel is a perfect blend of '80s nostalgia, friendship, and demonic possession. Set in the 1980s, "My Best Friend's Exorcism" follows the story of two high school friends, Abby and Gretchen, whose bond is tested when Gretchen begins to exhibit disturbing behavior after a night in the woods. As Abby tries to save her friend from the clutches of evil, the novel weaves in dark humor and heartfelt moments amid the horror.

### 2. "Meddling Kids" by Edgar Cantero

"Meddling Kids" puts a hilarious spin on the classic teen detective group trope, reminiscent of a certain mystery-solving gang with a talking dog.

As they face their fears and unravel the mystery, the story is filled with witty banter, pop culture references, and unexpected twists.

### 3. "Horrorstör" by Grady Hendrix

In "Horrorstör," Hendrix takes readers on a terrifying and humorous journey through a haunted IKEA-inspired furniture store.

The novel cleverly combines elements of horror with the mundanity of retail work, resulting in a darkly comedic and spine-tingling tale.

### 4. "John Dies at the End" by David Wong

"John Dies at the End" is a mind-bending blend of horror, humor, and surrealism that follows two friends, David and John, as they navigate a world filled with otherworldly creatures, mind-altering substances, and a mysterious drug known as Soy Sauce. As the duo grapples with bizarre events and existential threats, the story unfolds in a chaotic and comedic fashion, keeping readers guessing until the very end.

### 5. "The Last Final Girl" by Stephen Graham Jones

"The Last Final Girl" subverts the traditional slasher film genre by injecting it with humor, meta-commentary, and unexpected twists.

As the story unfolds, it plays with the conventions of horror movies while delivering dark humor and clever deconstructions of the genre.
