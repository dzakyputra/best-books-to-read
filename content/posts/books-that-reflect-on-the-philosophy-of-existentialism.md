"The Stranger" is a classic existentialist novel that tells the story of Meursault, a detached and apathetic protagonist who attends his mother's funeral and becomes entangled in a series of events that culminate in a murder trial. Camus explores the themes of alienation, the absurdity of life, and the indifference of the universe. Through Meursault's detached and existentialist perspective, readers are prompted to question the meaning and purpose of their own existence.

### 2. "Being and Nothingness" by Jean-Paul Sartre

Considered one of the foundational works of existentialism, "Being and Nothingness" is a dense philosophical treatise that delves into Sartre's ontology of consciousness. Sartre explores the concepts of freedom, authenticity, and the anguish of human existence. He argues that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals have the freedom to create their own meaning and purpose in life. This book is a challenging but rewarding read for those seeking a deeper understanding of existentialist philosophy.

### 3. "Existentialism Is a Humanism" by Jean-Paul Sartre

In this concise and accessible lecture, Sartre provides a comprehensive overview of existentialism and its core principles. He addresses criticisms of existentialism and defends its humanistic and optimistic perspective. Sartre emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and responsibility, asserting that we are solely responsible for creating our own values and determining the course of our lives. "Existentialism Is a Humanism" serves as an excellent introduction to existentialist philosophy for both beginners and seasoned readers.

### 4. "Nausea" by Jean-Paul Sartre

"Nausea" is a philosophical novel that follows the protagonist Antoine Roquentin as he experiences a profound existential crisis. Roquentin grapples with the absurdity and meaninglessness of existence, experiencing a sense of nausea in response to the mundane and ordinary aspects of life. Sartre's vivid and introspective writing style immerses readers in Roquentin's existential angst, inviting them to reflect on their own existence and the authenticity of their lived experiences.

### 5. "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus

"The Myth of Sisyphus" is a philosophical essay by Albert Camus that explores the concept of the absurd and the philosophical implications of embracing life's inherent meaninglessness. Camus uses the myth of Sisyphus, a figure condemned to endlessly roll a boulder up a hill, as a metaphor for the human condition. He argues that despite the absurdity of existence, individuals can find meaning and purpose through the act of rebellion and the embrace of life's fleeting moments of happiness.
