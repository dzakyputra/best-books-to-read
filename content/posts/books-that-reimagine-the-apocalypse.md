### 2. "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy

A harrowing tale of survival and love, "The Road" follows a father and son as they journey through a desolate, post-apocalyptic world.

### 3. "Oryx and Crake" by Margaret Atwood

King masterfully blends elements of horror, fantasy, and epic storytelling to create a sprawling narrative that explores themes of good versus evil, community, and the resilience of the human spirit.

### 5. "Parable of the Sower" by Octavia E. Butler
