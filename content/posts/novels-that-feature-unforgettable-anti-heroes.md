They are flawed, morally ambiguous characters who often find themselves in morally gray situations, making them compelling and unforgettable. Here are five novels that feature unforgettable anti-heroes that will leave a lasting impression on readers:

### 1. "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov

Humbert Humbert, the protagonist of "Lolita," is a prime example of an anti-hero. He is a middle-aged literature professor who becomes obsessed with a twelve-year-old girl named Lolita. Humbert's twisted and delusional mind makes him a complex and morally reprehensible character. Despite his despicable actions, Nabokov's masterful storytelling forces readers to grapple with their feelings towards Humbert, blurring the lines between sympathy and revulsion.

### 2. "American Psycho" by Bret Easton Ellis

Patrick Bateman, the protagonist of "American Psycho," is a wealthy investment banker living in Manhattan who leads a double life as a serial killer. Bateman's narcissism, materialism, and violent tendencies portray a chilling portrayal of the dark side of the American Dream. Ellis's graphic and satirical depiction of Bateman's psyche challenges readers to confront the uglier aspects of society and human nature.

### 3. "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn

Nick Dunne, one of the central characters in "Gone Girl," is an anti-hero who finds himself entangled in a web of deceit and manipulation orchestrated by his wife, Amy.

Flynn's intricate narrative keeps readers on the edge of their seats, questioning their perceptions of morality and justice.

### 4. "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë

Brontë's exploration of Heathcliff's complex emotions and motivations makes him a timeless and unforgettable anti-hero.

### 5. "Fight Club" by Chuck Palahniuk

Tyler Durden, the enigmatic and anarchic figure in "Fight Club," embodies the anti-hero archetype with his rejection of societal norms and embrace of chaos.
