Synesthesia, a rare neurological condition where one sensory or cognitive pathway is involuntarily triggered by another, has fascinated many writers and readers alike. In literature, synesthesia is often used as a unique plot element to add depth, complexity, and intrigue to the storytelling. Here are five novels that skillfully incorporate synesthesia as a major plot element:

### 1. "A Mango-Shaped Space" by Wendy Mass

In this young adult novel, the protagonist Mia has synesthesia, which allows her to see colors when she hears sounds or reads words.

### 2. "The Museum of Extraordinary Things" by Alice Hoffman

Set in early 20th-century New York City, this novel follows the intertwined lives of Coralie, a girl with webbed fingers who works as a mermaid in her father's museum, and Eddie, a photographer with the ability to see people's true natures. Synesthesia plays a pivotal role in the characters' interactions and decisions, adding a magical and otherworldly element to the story.

### 3. "The Color of Bee Larkham's Murder" by Sarah J. Harris

### 4. "The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie" by Alan Bradley

### 5. "A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" by Mark Haddon

Whether used to enhance characterization, plot development, or thematic exploration, synesthesia adds a layer of intrigue and enchantment to these compelling works of fiction.
